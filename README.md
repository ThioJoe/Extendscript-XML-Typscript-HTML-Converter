# Extendscript XML to Typescript Browser-Based Converter

Converts the XML Dom generated by Extendscript Toolkit to a Typescript file. Also attempts to fix some apparent malformations that exist in the original XML.

Work in progress. See wiki for currently known issues.

## How to use
1. Open Extendscript Toolkit CC, and at the top left dropdown select the app you want to get the XML file for. Not all work, but Premiere Pro does for example.
2. It should generate the XML file in: `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\ExtendScript Toolkit\4.0`
    - For Premiere Pro the filename will look something like: `omv$premierepro-25.0$25.4.0.xml`
3. Download the repo, open the `Tools` folder, and run `Index.html`. Drag the XML file onto the page, then save the converted file.
